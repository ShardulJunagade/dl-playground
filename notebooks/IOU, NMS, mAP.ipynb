    "In this notebook, I have implemented the following utilities for Object Detection:\n",

    "- **Intersection over Union (IOU) Calculation**: A metric used to evaluate the accuracy of an object detector by measuring the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box.\n",
    "- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: An algorithm used to select the best bounding box when multiple bounding boxes are predicted for a single object by suppressing all other boxes that have a high overlap (IOU) with the selected box.\n",
    "- **Mean Average Precision (mAP) Computation**: A metric used to evaluate the performance of an object detector by calculating the average precision for each class and then averaging over all classes. Implemented using both the Area Method and 11 points interpolation.\n",

    "These implementations may not be the fastest or most efficient, but they provide a clear understanding of the underlying concepts and algorithms."
